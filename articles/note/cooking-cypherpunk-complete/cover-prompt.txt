1280x670 pixels. Minimalist conceptual art.

A vintage recipe card dissolving into streams of clean code and data nodes. The paper transforms into geometric digital structures mid-air.

Kitchen elements abstracted: a knife reduced to a silver line, an onion as concentric circles, steam as flowing data paths.

Color palette: muted silver, warm beige, soft greige tones. No harsh contrasts.

Style: Japanese editorial illustration meets Swiss design. Empty space as compositional element. Subtle grain texture.

Mood: quiet revolution, knowledge becoming free, analog to digital liberation.

No text, no people, no faces.
